                                     Let's talk about move in dates
  MultiOptionsSegment             1. How urgent is your movein?
  DatePickerSegment               2. What is the ideal movein date?
  DateRangeSegment                3. Whats your movein range?
  MapSegment                      4. Where are you moving from? What is your current city?
  MultiOptionsSegment             4a. Only if current city is in Ontario: What is your current housing situation?
  MultiOptionsSegment             4aa. Only if current housing situation is leaving an existing lease: Have you given your mandatory 2 months notice yet?
  MessageSegment                  4aa. Only if current housing situation is escaping an existing lease: I cannot legally advise you on how to escape your current lease, but here are some helpful resources. I can still help you find matching rentals.
  DatePickerSegment               4b. Only if current city is outside Ontario: When will you arrive in Ontario and be ready to go on tours?
  MultiOptionsSegment             5. Will you be able to visit properties in person, or will you need a representative to help? (friend, family, or agent)
  CounterSegment                  6. How long of a lease are you looking for?
  InputSegment                    7. Can you tell me a little bit about why you're moving?
  MultiOptionsSegment             8. Which of these are the biggest factors to your movein choice?
  ActionSegment                   Ok I've filtered out the rentals that fit your move-in preferences.
                                  Some online ads don't mention the move-in date or lease length, so I will still show those.
                                  Ready to see your matches?
